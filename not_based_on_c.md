# Not based on C

This document discusses the blog post [Let's stop copying C](https://eev.ee/blog/2016/12/01/lets-stop-copying-c/) and how it has inspired Atium.

So it's an opinion piece, but the interesting part is that it compares these in context with other languages and what variations exist to solve the problems.
